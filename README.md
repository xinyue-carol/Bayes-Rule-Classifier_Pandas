# ML Project Introduction
This ML Project is my first personal project when I start my journey of studing data science. \
The coding langauage used for this Machine Learning Project is Python, and main package are pandas and numpy. The goal of this project is to creat the process of Navie bayes rule classifier.
The data source is randomly generated by a generator created, with 5 atributes, and 3 class.\
More detailed steps are introduced in the pdf file, and I have the code for data generation, classifier and optimization and cross validation python code attached as well.
